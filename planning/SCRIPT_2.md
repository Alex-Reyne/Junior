| Sarah  | Hey Karolina! It’s been so long. What have you been up to?                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Kar    | Yeah, it has! I’ve just been so busy working at a medical office after completing my biology degree.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Sarah  | Wow, that sounds cool! You know I was working in translation and events in Japan for a while, right? After I came back to Canada, I joined a web development bootcamp and I just graduated.                                                                  |
| Kar    | Oh, no way! I just graduated from a web dev bootcamp as well! How have things been after the bootcamp?                                                                                                                                                       |
| Sarah  | Well, I was so busy with bootcamp that I didn’t have any time to build a portfolio. I wish there was somewhere where I could do that but also where I could find jobs, like specifically ones at my level, and showcase all of my projects in a nice format. |
| Kar    | Oh! There actually is a website where you can do all that AND find freelance work to do, to build your portfolio with! It’s called Junior.                                                                                                                   |

| Sarah  | And that's all we have to show you today. We worked tirelessly for the last two weeks and learned a lot about our stack - specifically Postgres, React and Material UI, but also about working as a team and collaborating. We definitely found our strengths in different areas as we made progress. Personally I loved maintaining the database in Postgres and learning Material UI to achieve the design we wanted. |
| Kar    | I enjoyed working on the database in Postgres, the backend routes with Express, designing the front-end and implementing it. In the future, we want to add a chat and scheduling feature so that employers and devs would have an easier time communicating. We are really excited to get to show you our project. If you'd like to chat with us after the program you can find us in the Junior Stacks sessions room.  |
| Sarah  | We'd love to have you! Thanks for listening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
