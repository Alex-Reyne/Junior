| Sarah | Hey Karolina! It’s been so long. What have you been up to?
| Kar | Yeah, it has! I’ve just been so busy working at a medical office after completing my biology degree.
| Sarah | Wow, that sounds cool! You know I was working in translation and events in Japan for a while, right? After I came back to Canada, I joined a web development bootcamp and I just graduated. 
| Kar | Oh, no way! I just graduated from a web dev bootcamp as well! What have you been doing since?
| | A wild Alex appears |
| Alex | Hey! Sorry I’m late, what are you guys talking about?
| Sarah | Oh we were just talking about web development! Me and Karolina just got into it recently!
| Alex | Oh No way! Me too! I was doing freelance graphic design for the last few years but it’s gotten a lot harder since covid.
| Sarah | Yeah, true. I’ve been so busy with bootcamp though that I haven’t had any time to build a portfolio. I wish there was somewhere I could find jobs, like specifically ones at my level  and showcase some of my projects in a nice format.
| Kar | Oh! I heard about this site where you can do all that AND find freelance work to build your portfolio with!
| Alex | Oh wait you’re talking about Junior! I use that site all the time now, here let me show you...

| Person | Line |
--- | --- |
| Sarah | And that's all we have to show you today. We worked tirelessly for the last two weeks and learned a lot about our stack - specifically Postgres, React and Material UI, but also about working as a team and collaborating. We definitely found our strengths in different areas as we made progress. Personally I loved maintaining the database in Postgres and learning Material UI to achieve the design we wanted.
| Alex | My favourite part was Building the frontend with React Router and . We are really excited to get to show you our project. If you'd like to chat with us after the program you can find us in the Junior Stacks sessions room. |
| Sarah | We'd love to have you! Thanks for listening. |

*wave goodbye and BE DONE FINALLY*
